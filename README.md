# Gulshan Kumar's Portfolio

## 🎯 About the Project

This is my personal portfolio website created using AI tools like **ChatGPT** and **Claude AI**. I did not write any code manually — the entire site was built through AI-generated code based on my detailed prompts. The goal was to create a modern and professional portfolio while exploring how AI can assist in development.

## 🧠 How It Was Built

- Used **ChatGPT** and **Claude AI** to generate all the code
- Gave structured prompts for layout, design, and animations
- Iterated based on visual output and improved via AI suggestions
- Deployed using GitHub Pages

## ✅ QA Involvement

Although I didn't write the code, I applied my **QA expertise** throughout the project:

- **Manual Testing**
  - Checked layout, design, and responsiveness on different devices
  - Verified all links, navigation, and scroll behaviors
  - Reviewed UI consistency and smoothness

- **Automation Testing (Basic)**
  - Wrote Playwright test cases for UI validation

These practices helped ensure the final site works well across browsers, screen sizes, and interactions.
